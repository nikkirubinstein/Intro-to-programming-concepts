## Slide presentation

There are two slide presentations that can be used to present the material described in this book:

* [Shiny presentation](../Intro_slides.Rmd)
* [HTML presentation](../Intro_slides_NOTSHINY.html)

The HTML presentation can be run in any browser. The Shiny presentation needs to be run through RStudio (open the document in RStudio and click run presentation - make sure that shiny has been installed). The Shiny presentation has interactive sections for the slides on conditionals and functions.

## Interactive teaching techniques

This can be a really fun course to run. Here are some examples of interactive activities that you can use:

* Split the attendees into teams and get them to come up with team names. Use these team names throughout the workshop when asking for volunteers
* To illustrate the different data types, print out squares of coloured paper (use a different colour for each data type) and get attendees to fill in examples of the appropriate data type for each square. Here is a [template](../data types - print on coloured paper.docx)
* Ask attendees to use the coloured paper data types to create examples of data structures
* Create data structures of people. Get a team to come up to the front and demonstrate a vector/matrix/list of people
* When discussing conditionals, get attendees to play 'Simon Says'
* When discussing loops, get attendees to give you dance moves to dance out. Show the code written as both a loop and as an exhaustive list of instructions
* When discussing functions, get attendees to act as your computer and ask them for the output to a function, such as `nameTheSinger`
* Get attendees to email you their scratch creations so that you can have a show-and-tell session at the end of the workshop
