Introduction
------------

When you start coding, google is your friend. It will often direct you
to a website called stackoverflow where people post and answer
programming-related questions. Also come see us at ResBaz. We are happy
to set up free consultations with you to discuss your programming
challenges. Learning to program is a lot about making mistakes. It’s
great for someone to warn you about something, but until you make the
mistake yourself, you often won’t understand it. Don’t be afraid to make
mistakes. Here are some resources if you would like to continue with
some self-directed learning. Otherwise you can sign up to one of our
free workshops via the top link
