## Where to find help

When you start coding (and even when you are an experienced coder), [Google](www.google.com.au) is your friend. Google searches will often direct you to a website called [stackoverflow](stackoverflow.com) where people post and answer programming-related questions.

## Don't be afraid of making mistakes

Learning to program is a lot about making mistakes. It’s great for someone to warn you about something, but you won't truly understand until you make the mistake yourself. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes!
