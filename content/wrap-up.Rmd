## Introduction

When you start coding, google is your friend. It will often direct you to a website called stackoverflow where people post and answer programming-related questions. Also come see us at ResBaz. We are happy to set up free consultations with you to discuss your programming challenges.
Learning to program is a lot about making mistakes. It’s great for someone to warn you about something, but until you make the mistake yourself, you often won’t understand it. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes. 
Here are some resources if you would like to continue with some self-directed learning. Otherwise you can sign up to one of our free workshops via the top link
