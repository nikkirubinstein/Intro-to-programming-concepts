Slide presentation
------------------

There are two slide presentations that can be used to present this
materials: \* [Shiny presentation](Intro_slides.Rmd) \* [HTML
presentation](Intro_slides_NOTSHINY.html)

The HTML presentation can be run in any browser. The Shiny presentation
needs to be run through RStudio (open the document in RStudio and click
run presentation - make sure that shiny has been installed). The Shiny
presentation has interactive sections for the slides on conditionals and

Interactive teaching techniques
-------------------------------

This can be a really fun course to run. Here are some examples of
interactive activities that you can use:

-   Split the attendees into teams and get them to come up with
    team names. Use these team names throughout the workshop when asking
    for volunteers
-   To illustrate the different data types, Print out squares of
    coloured paper (use a different colour for each data type) and get
    attendees to fill in examples of the appropriate data type for
    each square. Here is a
    [template](data%20types%20-%20print%20on%20coloured%20paper.docx)
-   Ask attendees to use the coloured paper data types to create
    examples of data structures
-   Create data structures of people. Get a team to come up to the front
    and demonstrate a vector/matrix/list of people
-   When discussing conditionals, get attendees to play 'Simon Says'
-   When discussing loops, get attendees to give you dance moves to
    dance out. Show the code written as both a loop and as an exhaustive
    list of instructions
-   When discussing functions, get attendees to act as your computer and
    ask them for the output to a function, such as `nameTheSinger`
-   Get attendees to email you their scratch creations so that you can
    have a show-and-tell session at the end of the workshop
